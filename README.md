## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This project was a personal challenge and a labor of love. I developed it entirely on my own, from coding to integrating assets. It was a rewarding experience where I learned a lot about game mechanics, user interface design, and problem-solving with Python.

I'm proud of what I accomplished, but I'm always looking to improve! If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to chat about game development, feel free to reach out or open an issue.
